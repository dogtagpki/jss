Network Security Services for Java (JSS)
========================================

Overview
--------

**Network Security Services for Java** is a Java interface to [NSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS).
JSS supports most of the security standards and encryption technologies supported by NSS.
JSS also provides a pure Java interface for ASN.1 types and BER/DER encoding.

Building
--------

To build JSS and make a best effort to detect environment variables:

    git clone https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss
    cd jss/build && cmake ..
    make all test

Alternatively, to build a RPM distribution of JSS:

    git clone https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss
    cd jss
    ./build.sh
