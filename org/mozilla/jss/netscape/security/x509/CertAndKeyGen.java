/**
 * Generate a pair of keys, and provide access to them. This class is
 * provided primarily for ease of use.
 *
 * <P>
 * This provides some simple certificate management functionality. Specifically, it allows you to create self-signed
 * X.509 certificates as well as PKCS 10 based certificate signing requests.
 *
 * <P>
 * Keys for some public key signature algorithms have algorithm parameters, such as DSS/DSA. Some sites' Certificate
 * Authorities adopt fixed algorithm parameters, which speeds up some operations including key generation and signing.
 * <em>At this time, this interface
 * does not provide a way to provide such algorithm parameters, e.g.
 * by providing the CA certificate which includes those parameters.</em>
 *
 * <P>
 * Also, note that at this time only signature-capable keys may be acquired through this interface. Diffie-Hellman keys,
 * used for secure key exchange, may be supported later.
