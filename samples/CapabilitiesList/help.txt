Usage: build.sh [-h] [-b] [-s] [-t]

This script builds capabilites apps with make.

Capabilities build tool options:

    -h               display this help and exit
    -b               path to where jss was built
    -s               path to slf4j jar file, either system's or latest built
    -t               target for makefile [ empty for build | run ]


Since './build.sh -t clean' is not working, use the Makefile directly to
remove classes and/or the listings directory.
