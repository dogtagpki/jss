Builds against the system jss need manual adjustments
As stated in systemjssMakefile change
 
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${librarypath4fedora}
 export CLASSPATH=${classpath4fedora}
  
 to

 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${librarypath4opensuse}
 export CLASSPATH=${classpath4opensuse}

 These are meant to be strictly local changes.
