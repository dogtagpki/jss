A facility for encrypting and decrypting small amounts of data with
a symmetric key. This is most commonly used for encrypting password files
to implement single sign-on.

<p>KeyManager is used to create, lookup, and delete the symmetric keys used
 for SecretDecoderRing. Encryptor is used to encrypt data. Decryptor is used
to decrypt data that was previously encrypted with Encryptor. Encoding
and Encoding.Template are used internally, but they were made public
because they may occasionally be useful to applications.
