# There are two implementation strategies available on AIX:
# pthreads, and pthreads-user.  The default is pthreads.
# In both strategies, we need to use pthread_user.c, instead of
# aix.c.  The fact that aix.c is never used is somewhat strange.
# 
# So we need to do the following:
# - Default (PTHREADS_USER not defined in the environment or on
#   the command line):
#   Set PTHREADS_USER=1, USE_PTHREADS=1
# - PTHREADS_USER=1 set in the environment or on the command line:
#   Do nothing.
#

	USE_PTHREADS =            # just to be safe
	IMPL_STRATEGY = _PTH_USER
else
	USE_PTHREADS = 1
	PTHREADS_USER = 1
