# win16_3.11.mk -- Make configuration for Win16
#
# This file configures gmake to build the Win16 variant of
# NSPR 2.0. This file has the function of two files commonly
# used on other platforms, for example: winnt.mk and
# winnt4.0.mk. ... The packaging is easier and there is only
# one variant of the Win16 target.
# 
# Win16 is built using the Watcom C/C++ version 11.0
# compiler. You gotta set up the compiler first. 
# The Watcom compiler depends on a few environment
# variables; these environment variables define where the
# compiler components are installed; they must be set before
# running the make.
# 
# Notes:
# OS_CFLAGS is the command line options for the compiler when
#   building the .DLL object files.
# OS_EXE_CFLAGS is the command line options for the compiler
#   when building the .EXE object files; this is for the test
#   programs.
# the macro OS_CFLAGS is set to OS_EXE_CFLAGS inside of the
#   makefile for the pr/tests directory. ... Hack.
